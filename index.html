        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Beavers (genus Castor) are large, semiaquatic rodents of the Northern Hemisphere. There are two existing species:</p>
    
        <h3>North American Beaver (Castor canadensis)</h3>
        <p>The North American beaver is one of the two existing species of beavers. It is known for its stout body, long chisel-like incisors, and brown or gray fur. These beavers are the second-largest living rodents, with adults weighing up to 50 kg (110 lb). Their distinctive features include hand-like front feet, webbed back feet, and flat, scaly tails.</p>
    
        <h3>Eurasian Beaver (C. fiber)</h3>
        <p>The Eurasian beaver, the other existing species, differs from the North American beaver in terms of skull and tail shape, as well as fur color. They are also semiaquatic rodents inhabiting freshwater environments like rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds.</p>
    
        <p>Beavers are herbivorous, primarily consuming tree bark, aquatic plants, grasses, and sedges. They play a vital role in their ecosystems by building dams and lodges using tree branches, vegetation, rocks, and mud.</p>
    
        <p>Beaver dams restrict water flow, while lodges serve as shelters. This infrastructure creates wetlands used by many other species, making beavers a keystone species in their ecosystems.</p>
    
        <p>Adult male and female beavers live in monogamous pairs with their offspring. Young beavers help their parents repair dams and lodges after their first year, and older siblings may assist in raising newly-born offspring. Beavers mark their territories using scent mounds made of mud, debris, and castoreum, a liquid substance excreted through the beaver's urethra-based castor sacs. They can also recognize their kin by their anal gland secretions and are more likely to tolerate them as neighbors.</p>
    
        <p>Historically, beavers have been hunted for their fur, meat, and castoreum, which has been used in medicine, perfume, and food flavoring. Beaver pelts were a major driver of the fur trade. Fortunately, conservation efforts have allowed beaver populations to rebound, and they are now listed as species of least concern by the IUCN Red List of mammals.</p>
    
        <p>In human culture, the beaver symbolizes industriousness, especially in connection with construction. Notably, it is the national animal of Canada.</p>
